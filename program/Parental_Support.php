                   Parents should take a multipronged approach to social media management, including time limits, parental monitoring and supervision, and ongoing discussions about social media. As noted above, time limits can help teens with self-control and encourage moderate social media use. Limiting chat functions, especially among strangers, and limiting exposure to adult content is also recommended. Particularly for younger teens, parents may consider allowing social media use only when children are at home so that parents can keep a closer eye on their online activities.</p>

Show friendly behavior, Lead them by example, Set Limit for screen time, Spend quality time with them, Teach them how to use social media.Since it is nearly impossible to separate social media from kids, it’s better to teach them how to use it. You can guide them on what to share and what not to share on social media. Furthermore, you also educated them about the privacy settings. Ask them not to add the unknown person as a friend and share any information. So rather than getting worried about the usage of social media by your kids, it is wise to teach your kid what to use in social media and when to use it. </p>

                                            <p>As a parent, you have to acknowledge the fact that your kids are using social media. Here are some ways how you deal with this fact. Show friendly behavior, Lead them by example, Set Limit for screen time, Spend quality time with them, Teach them how to use social media.Since it is nearly impossible to separate social media from kids, it’s better to teach them how to use it. You can guide them on what to share and what not to share on social media. Furthermore, you also educated them about the privacy settings. Ask them not to add the unknown person as a friend and share any information. So rather than getting worried about the usage of social media by your kids, it is wise to teach your kid what to use in social media and when to use it.</p>
