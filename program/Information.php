                    <h2>Outstanding Solutions For your Needs</h2>
                    <p>The way social media is designed is dangerous. It is driving a youth mental health crisis and damaging millions of lives. Algorithms drive us towards darker and darker content because this makes more money from advertising. But it doesn’t have to be this way.We're taking action against the harmful business models that put us and our children at risk. Join our fight for Safer Socials. Social media is damaging the lives of young people in the UK. Our SMC campaign have been built on the recognition that: 9 in 10 youth mental health specialists say exposure to harmful beauty content on social media can lead to physical consequences, like disordered eating or self-harm.More than half of kids say social media makes them and their peers feel anxious, and 3 in 4 say social media makes them want to change their appearance. 1 in 3 who recalled seeing self-harm content on Instagram reported that they reported that they have performed the same (or very similar) self harming behaviour as a consequence 8 in 10 parents say the impact of social media on mental health is worrying.We are being gaslit by Big Tech. Parents are made to feel guilty for not protecting their children, young people are shamed for too much time on it, yet billions of £££ss go into designing platforms to keep us on them. The blame and shame must not be on parents and kids, it must be on those who have the power to make social media safer. Social media is here to stay and so we must change it for the better. We have a big but critical fight ahead of us – please donate and help Global Action Plan to: Hold Big Tech to account: Big Tech can wiggle out of making real changes while there is a lack of public pressure to regulate them. Help us collect the stories and data of lives affected and rally the public to call for change. Call on Government to make Socials safe: Tech experts have put forward the changes that need to be made. Help us campaign to government to put these changes into law. Protect young people today: The focus MUST be on changing social media but this will take time. Support our work with psychologists and educators to share resources that help us all use social media safely today</p>
