                    <h2>Overview Of An Live Streaming</h2>
                    <p>Streaming is the method of data transmission used when someone watches video on the Internet. It is a way to deliver a video file a little bit at a time, often from a remote storage location. By transmitting a few seconds of the file at a time over the internet, client devices do not have to download the entire video before starting to play it. Live streaming is when the streamed video is sent over the Internet in real time, without first being recorded and stored. Today, TV broadcasts, video game streams, and social media video can all be live-streamed. Think about the difference between regular streaming and live streaming as the difference between an actor reciting a memorized monologue and improvising a speech. In the former, the content is created beforehand, stored, and then relayed to the audience. In the latter, the audience receives the content in the same moment that the actor creates it – just like in live streaming. These are the main steps that take place behind the scenes in a live stream:Compression, Encoding, Segmentation, Content delivery network (CDN) distribution, CDN caching, Decoding, Video playback, Video capture</p>

           <h2>Type Of Live Streams</h2>
           <h4 class="underline">TYPE ONE – IN-PERSON</h4>
                   <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size:20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
                    The first type of live stream we’ll talk about is physical, or in-person. This is where we set up in a physical venue, have presenters, speakers and hosts all on a stage, talking to a virtual audience who could be watching anywhere in the world. Participants on the stream might physically present on stage, or join via video call, so they can talk to the host of the event or do their own presentation. An example of this is the Birmingham Royal Ballet International Dance Week Festival live stream.  </p>
            <h4 class="underline">TYPE TWO – HYBRID</h4>
                   <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size:20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
                  The second type of live stream is a hybrid. Similarly to the first type of live stream, we set up in a physical location but add the layer of an audience in the room. For something like this, we would then have to consider adding extra sound and visual requirements, such as loud speakers and extra screens for the audience in the room. An example of this is the live stream we filmed with the Great Britain Judo team.  </p>
            <h4 class="underline">TYPE THREE – VIRTUAL</h4>
                   <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size:20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
                   The third type of live stream is going completely virtual. We have no physical presence and we can stream your virtual event from our offices. All speakers, presenters and hosts appear via video call, which we can then run through our software and then push out again through a virtual stage. We’ve used this variation where we have participants calling in from across the world.  </p>

                <h2>How it can be done in a safe environment</h2>
                    <h4 class="underline">Password protection</h4>
                   <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size:20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
                    One way to control who has access to your live streams is to implement password protection. This way, you can distribute your password to the relevant people and ensure that no potentially sensitive content is accessed by the wrong people. While hackers have been known to find ways to access passwords, it’s a simple way to share your video content with a specific set of people.   </p>
            
              <h4 class="underline">Payment encryption</h4>
                   <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size:20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
                  If you’re live streaming an event, webinar, debate, or anything online in exchange for payment, it’s essential to make sure your customers' payments are protected. Fail to do so, and you risk finding yourself in tricky legal scenarios or losing out on potential customers if they don’t feel confident in providing their payment details. To secure your payment process for viewers, you should use SSL encryption. This uses an encryption algorithm to protect all information being passed between servers, including highly sensitive and personal information like payment details.   </p>
            
              <h4 class="underline">Geographic or domain restrictions</h4>
                   <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size:20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
                    Domain restrictions allow you to control which specific domains have permission to embed your streams. Simply make a list of all the domains that are allowed access to your embed code, and any that aren’t on the list will be unable to play your videos on their site. To go one step further, you can place restrictions on the specific areas and locations that can play or view your live streams. If you only want to open your streams up to viewers in certain countries or areas, you can identify the relevant IP addresses and prevent foreign countries from tuning in.</p>
            
              <h4 class="underline">Copyright control</h4>
                   <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size:20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
                   A copyright is something that a content creator owns which prevents anyone else from using your videos, whether it's to publish, recreate, repurpose and more. By holding the copyright to a video, only you or your brand has the rights to that content, preventing others from benefiting from your ideas and hard work.</p>
